the issue to be a race between applying `JobBatchDeregisterRequest` fsm operation and processing job-deregister evals.\n\nProcessing job-deregister evals should wait until the FSM log message finishes applying, by using the snapshot index.  However, with `JobBatchDeregister`, any single individual job deregistering was applied accidentally incremented the snapshot index and resulted into processing job-deregister evals.  When a Nomad server receives an eval for a job in the batch that is yet to be deleted, we accidentally re-run it depending on the state of allocation.\n\nThis change ensures that we delete deregister all of the jobs and inserts all evals in a single transactions, thus blocking processing related evals until deregistering complete.\n","author_name":"Mahmood

Given\nthat `nomad alloc status` is called rarely generally (compared to stats\ntelemetry and general job reporting), it seems fine.  However, the\nlookup overhead grows bounded by number of `tasks x total-host-devices`,\nwhich can be significant.\n\n* `client.Client` performs the task devices->statistics lookup.  It\npasses self to alloc/task runners so they can look up the device statistics\nallocated to them.\n  * Currently alloc/task runners are responsible for constructing the\nentire RPC response for stats\n  * The alternatives for making task runners device statistics aware\ndon't seem appealing (e.g. having task runners contain reference to hostStats)\n\n* On the alloc aggregation resource usage, I did a naive merging of task device statistics.\n  * Personally, I question the value of such aggregation, compared to\ncosts of struct duplication and bloating the response - but opted to be\nconsistent in the API.\n  * With naive concatination, device instances from a single device group used by separate tasks in the alloc, would be aggregated in two separate device group statistics.\n","author_name":"Mahmood

again, even if it's no longer\nvalid.\n\nThis PR fixes it by resetting the bufio Writer, which resets any errors\nand tries to write requested data.\n","author_name":"Marcin

client.alloc_runner.task_runner: some environment variables not available for rendering: ... keys=\"attr.driver.docker.volumes.enabled, attr.driver.docker.version, attr.driver.docker.bridge_ip, attr.driver.qemu.version\"\n```\n\nNot only should we not be erroring on builtin driver attributes, but the\nresults were nondeterministic due to map iteration order!\n\nThe root cause is that we have an old root attribute for all drivers\nlike:\n\n```\nattr.driver.docker = \"1\"\n```\n\nWhen attributes were opaque variable names it was fine to also have\n\"nested\" attributes like:\n\n```\nattr.driver.docker.version = \"1.2.3\"\n```\n\nHowever in the HCLv2 world the variable names are no longer opaque: they\nform an object tree. The `docker` object can no longer both hold a value\n(`\"1\"`) *and* nested attributes (`version = \"1.2.3\"`).\n\n**The Fix:**\n\nSince the old `attr.driver.<name> = \"1\"` attribues are useless for task\nconfig interpolation, create a new precedence rule for creating the task\nconfig evaluation context:\n\n*Maps take precedence over primitives.*\n\nThis means `attr.driver.docker.version` will always take precedence over\n`attr.driver.docker`. The results are determinstic and give users access\nto the more useful metadata.\n\nI made this a general precedence rule instead of special-casing driver\nattrs because it seemed like better default behavior than spamming\nWARNings to logs that were likely unactionable by users.\n","author_name":"Michael

handle various hcl and json\nsyntax that was supported in 0.8.\n\nIn 0.8.7, the following declarations are effectively equivalent:\n\n```\n// hcl block\nport_map {\n  http = 80\n  https = 443\n}\n\n// hcl assignment\nport_map = {\n  http  = 80\n  https = 443\n}\n\n// json single element array of map (default in API response)\n{\"port_map\": [{\"http\": 80, \"https\": 443}]}\n\n// json array of individual maps (supported accidentally iiuc)\n{\"port_map: [{\"http\": 80}, {\"https\": 443}]}\n```\n\nWe achieve compatbility by using `NewAttr(\"...\", \"list(map(string))\",\nfalse)` to be serialized to a `map[string]string` wrapper, instead of using\n`BlockAttrs` declaration.

main benefit is management of opening fifo files.  In Linux,\na reader `open()` request would block until a writer opens the file (and\nvice-versa).  The library uses goroutines so that it's the first IO\noperation that blocks.\n\nThis benefit isn't really useful for us: Given that logmon simply\nstreams output in a separate process, blocking of opening or first read\nis effectively the same.\n\nThe library additionally makes further complications for managing state\nand tracking read/write permission that seems overhead for our use,\ncompared to using a file directly.\n\nLooking here, I made the following incidental changes:\n* document that we do handle if fifo files are already created, as we\nrely on that behavior for

and fix a regression introduced in 0.9 in marking files in libcontainer executable.\r\n\r\n#4809 bug is that `lookupBin` uses `exec.LookPath` when not inspecting task dir files.  `exec.LookPath` only returns a file if it's already marked as an executable path in https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.12.1/src/os/exec/lp_unix.go#L24-L27 .  This affects raw exec as if passed an absolute path to file, `lookupBin` returns an error if file isn't already an executable.  This explains why the error manifests when an absolute interpolated path is used (e.g. `${NOMAD_TASK_DIR}/hellov1`) but not when using a task rel dir (e.g. `local/hellov1`) in the above examples used in ticket.\r\n\r\nPR #4813 remedied this problem for raw exec but inadvertably broke libcontainer executor, as it made `lookupBin` returns the paths to host files rather than ones found inside chroot.\r\n\r\nThis PR reorders the evaluation, so we go back to 0.8 behavior of looking up task directories first, but then check for host paths before using `exec.LookPath`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is broken into three commits to illustrate evolution and confirming hypothesis:\r\n1. 9adab75ac84b5c2a7b84702fae02c2484abb50ad : Adding a test illustrating how libcontainer executor fails at marking processes as executable in https://travis-ci.org/hashicorp/nomad/jobs/514942694 - note that the test doesn't depend on artifacts or interpolated paths\r\n2. d441cdd52f68912e96dc7ee5baf2dcddb0ac8caa: reverting PR #4809 and showing the test fail now with raw_exec case (as expected) in https://travis-ci.org/hashicorp/nomad/jobs/514944065\r\n2. 244544b735a8dbac0e14e7ee85e12a39780cbbb9: in where we add the check in appropriate place next to `exec.LookPath(...)` for absolute paths and have a green job in https://travis-ci.org/hashicorp/nomad/jobs/514945024\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nInspecting `lookupBin` in 0.8 and 0.9 case, we have a bug in using `exec.LookPath` for the libcontainer executor case.  We should be looking up paths based on the container chroot and container PATH rather than the host's.  However, this is not a 0.9.0 regression and was present in 0.8; so punting to fix it post 0.9.","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@notnoop.com","parents":["800bd848c1667e83f929accac44af803ad237f10","244544b735a8dbac0e14e7ee85e12a39780cbbb9"]},{"hash":"a09fb7d7bf939186e7055a988d27a683e474235c","date":"2019-04-02 20:38:56 -0500","message":"small tweaks to load test jobs to make them work in Nomad 0.8.7","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Preetha Appan","author_email":"preetha@hashicorp.com","parents":["39555db45f1db1d7c08593cd5dd2279be6fcee6b"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"e2e/metrics/input/cpustress.nomad","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"e2e/metrics/input/memstress.nomad","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"e2e/metrics/input/redis.nomad","changes":4,"insertions":0,"deletions":4,"binary":false}],"insertions":2,"deletions":6,"changed":3}},{"hash":"6a838b8c3bc515074a6dd8b3af48bdf7fa2811c9","date":"2019-04-03 01:54:29 +0000","message":"Generate files for 0.9.0-rc2 release","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Nomad Release bot","author_email":"nomad@hashicorp.com","parents":["a09fb7d7bf939186e7055a988d27a683e474235c"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"client/structs/structs.generated.go","changes":9373,"insertions":35,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"command/agent/bindata_assetfs.go","changes":56,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"nomad/structs/structs.generated.go","changes":8473,"insertions":31,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"version/version.go","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":17875,"deletions":29,"changed":4}},{"hash":"865e433673f25849c40c6f67493208e6190d43ba","date":"2019-04-03 07:27:45 -0700","message":"Release v0.9.0-rc2","refs":["tag: v0.9.0-rc2"],"body":"","author_name":"Michael Schurter","author_email":"mschurter@hashicorp.com","parents":["6a838b8c3bc515074a6dd8b3af48bdf7fa2811c9"],"tag":"v0.9.0-rc2"},{"hash":"b51e9e09fc1dd4935cfb71c760276e1d1e802731","date":"2019-04-03 07:41:09 -0700","message":"Remove 0.9.0-rc2 generated files","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Michael Schurter","author_email":"mschurter@hashicorp.com","parents":["865e433673f25849c40c6f67493208e6190d43ba"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"client/structs/structs.generated.go","changes":9373,"insertions":0,"deletions":35,"binary":false},{"file":"nomad/structs/structs.generated.go","changes":8473,"insertions":0,"deletions":31,"binary":false},{"file":"version/version.go","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":1,"deletions":17847,"changed":3}},{"hash":"010b9575dbdb2d72b73f2be6fed5947360894959","date":"2019-04-03 07:46:28 -0700","message":"Bump download page to 0.9.0-rc2","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Michael Schurter","author_email":"mschurter@hashicorp.com","parents":["b51e9e09fc1dd4935cfb71c760276e1d1e802731"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"website/source/downloads.html.erb","changes":4,"insertions":2,"deletions":2,"binary":false}],"insertions":2,"deletions":2,"changed":1}},{"hash":"3bad050bf1d275c58d2af42860d3ebf2ab7bd69c","date":"2019-04-04 15:18:33 -0700","message":"client: simplify kill logic","refs":["origin/f-simplify-kill"],"body":"Remove runLaunched tracking as Run is *always* called for killable\nTaskRunners.

SIGPIPE\nresults into executor process dying.\n\nI considered adding a handler to ignore SIGPIPE, but hc-log library\ncurrently panics when logging write operation fails[2]\n\nThis we opt to revert to

We aim to reuse the\nprotobuf generated code as much as possible, without translation to avoid\nconversion overhead.\n\n`ExecTaskStream` abstract fetching and sending stream entities.  It's influenced\nby the grpc bi-directional stream interface, to avoid needing any adapter.

reasoning about service registration,\nthis becomes problematic when we add consul health checks to a service. When\nthe service is re-registered, so are the checks, which default to failing for\nat least one check period.\n\nThis commit migrates us to using a stable identifier based on the\nallocation, task, and service identifiers, and uses the difference\nbetween the remote and local state to decide when to push updates.\n\nIt uses the existing hashing mechanic to decide when UpdateTask should\nregenerate service registrations for providing to Sync, but this should\nbe removable as part of a future refactor.\n\nIt additionally introduces the _nomad-check- prefix for check\ndefinitions, to allow for future allowing of consul features like\nmaintenance mode.\n","author_name":"Danielle Lancashire","author_email":"dani@hashicorp.com","parents":["da8f67639f8a784e24bb9f3c410e6ab573d22f60"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"command/agent/consul/client.go","changes":60,"insertions":8,"deletions":3,"binary":false},{"file":"command/agent/consul/unit_test.go","changes":221,"insertions":10,"deletions":28,"binary":false}],"insertions":100,"deletions":181,"changed":2}},{"hash":"14c231aeb98cb91686c72d5686da354f32aacbf9","date":"2019-04-25 13:48:19 +0200","message":"consul: Do not deregister external checks","refs":["origin/dani/consul"],"body":"This commit causes sync to skip deregistering checks that are not\nmanaged by nomad, such as service maintenance mode checks.

handled by command CLI framework.  Plugin launchers use\n`discover.NomadBinary()` to identify the binary and start it.\n\nThis has few downsides: The trivial one is that when running tests, one\nmust re-compile the nomad binary as the tests need to invoke the nomad\nexecutable to start plugin.  This is frequently overlooked, resulting in\npuzzlement.\n\nThe more significant issue with `executor` in particular is in relation\nto external driver:\n\n* Plugin must identify the path of invoking nomad binary, which is not\ntrivial; `discvoer.NomadBinary()` now returns the path to the plugin\nrather than to nomad, preventing external drivers from launching\nexecutors.\n\n* The external driver may get a different version of executor than it\nexpects (specially if we make a binary incompatible change in future).\n\nThis commit addresses both downside by having the plugin invocation\nhandling through an `init()` call, similar to how libcontainer init\nhandler is done in [1] and recommened by libcontainer [2].  `init()`\nwill be invoked and handled properly in tests and external drivers.\n\nFor external drivers, this change will cause external drivers to launch\nthe executor that's compiled against.\n\nThere a are a couple of downsides to this approach:\n* These specific packages (i.e executor, logmon, and dockerlog) need to\nbe careful in use of `init()`, package initializers.  Must avoid having\ncommand execution rely on any other init in the package.  I prefixed\nfiles with `z_` (golang processes files in lexical order), but ensured\nwe don't depend on order.\n* The command handling is spread in multiple packages making it a bit\nless obvious how plugin starts are handled.\n\n[1] drivers/shared/executor/libcontainer_nsenter_linux.go\n[2] https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/eb4aeed24ffbf8e2d740fafea39d91faa0ee84d0/libcontainer#using-libcontainer\n","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@hashicorp.com","parents":["2a65ceeefcf9e6875d37180ccc0cb802c468c5f3"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"client/logmon/plugin.go","changes":4,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"client/logmon/z_logmon_cmd.go","changes":28,"insertions":12,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"command/commands.go","changes":16,"insertions":0,"deletions":7,"binary":false},{"file":"command/docker_logger_plugin.go","changes":43,"insertions":0,"deletions":17,"binary":false},{"file":"command/executor_plugin.go","changes":66,"insertions":0,"deletions":27,"binary":false},{"file":"command/logmon_plugin.go","changes":42,"insertions":0,"deletions":17,"binary":false},{"file":"drivers/docker/docklog/plugin.go","changes":4,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"drivers/docker/docklog/z_docker_logger_cmd.go","changes":29,"insertions":12,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"drivers/shared/executor/utils.go","changes":4,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"drivers/shared/executor/z_executor_cmd.go","changes":51,"insertions":21,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":114,"deletions":173,"changed":10}},{"hash":"5cfae0a399b16f9cec9d667abf12e8af2b8e8390","date":"2019-06-13 14:13:41 -0700","message":"Merge branch 'master' into docs-docs","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Michael Schurter","author_email":"mschurter@hashicorp.com","parents":["4a194473d7de38d45ee62d84da7a9824f29f9b3b","e2ee80481c34feac7c0510679ea22ef86776f2f6"]},{"hash":"6c0080a2527758a9dafa8cf0fe224f3d9852ac32","date":"2019-06-13 16:14:35 -0500","message":"Change sort arrow to pass through pointer events (#5833)","refs":[],"body":"Without this, clicking on the sort arrow didn’t change the\r\nsort direction.","author_name":"Buck Doyle","author_email":"buck@hashicorp.com","parents":["e2ee80481c34feac7c0510679ea22ef86776f2f6"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"ui/app/styles/core/table.scss","changes":1,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"changed":1}},{"hash":"77f5f004c7819a783c737137a6e20409c823db1a","date":"2019-06-13 14:19:41 -0700","message":"Merge pull request #5786 from hashicorp/docs-docs","refs":[],"body":"docs: initial attempt at developer docs","author_name":"Michael Schurter","author_email":"mschurter@hashicorp.com","parents":["6c0080a2527758a9dafa8cf0fe224f3d9852ac32","5cfae0a399b16f9cec9d667abf12e8af2b8e8390"]},{"hash":"2899991ccdb429c9f1d8dea93fbfc89c05136f19","date":"2019-06-13 17:28:59 -0400","message":"Merge pull request #5790 from hashicorp/b-reschedule-desired-state","refs":[],"body":"Mark rescheduled allocs as stopped.","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@hashicorp.com","parents":["77f5f004c7819a783c737137a6e20409c823db1a","25b44b18db53af1f95fa4f5ee02107a091a19356"]},{"hash":"fcd42f639221c537c126b6f7d556de421a612d58","date":"2019-06-13 14:41:56 -0700","message":"update changelog","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Jasmine Dahilig","author_email":"jasmine@dahilig.com","parents":["2899991ccdb429c9f1d8dea93fbfc89c05136f19"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"CHANGELOG.md","changes":4,"insertions":2,"deletions":2,"binary":false}],"insertions":2,"deletions":2,"changed":1}},{"hash":"84f11ccc8a45b38c41b8823356d59a4e76d0e973","date":"2019-06-13 16:55:00 -0700","message":"Update changelog","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Buck Doyle","author_email":"buck@hashicorp.com","parents":["fcd42f639221c537c126b6f7d556de421a612d58"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"CHANGELOG.md","changes":4,"insertions":4,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":4,"deletions":0,"changed":1}},{"hash":"90d488bcb5dd2bc8f78e01d163071eb49fc23ff3","date":"2019-06-14 10:57:46 -0400","message":"Avoid de-registering slowly restored services","refs":["origin/b-consul-restore-sync-2"],"body":"When a nomad client restarts/upgraded, nomad restores state from running\ntask and starts the sync loop.

This\nserves as a grace period for restoring to complete, or for operators to\nrestore should they recognize they restored with the wrong nomad data\ndirectory.\n","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@hashicorp.com","parents":["fcd42f639221c537c126b6f7d556de421a612d58"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"command/agent/consul/client.go","changes":74,"insertions":9,"deletions":3,"binary":false},{"file":"command/agent/consul/unit_test.go","changes":245,"insertions":37,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":299,"deletions":20,"changed":2}},{"hash":"91ee6caba5070ff150d64cf45182e3143e2654e1","date":"2019-06-14 08:55:13 -0700","message":"Update changelog properly","refs":[],"body":"I failed to amend my commit! 😭\n","author_name":"Buck Doyle","author_email":"buck@hashicorp.com","parents":["84f11ccc8a45b38c41b8823356d59a4e76d0e973"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"CHANGELOG.md","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"changed":1}},{"hash":"9de458457e6ad62576258a0b3af3ca34f033edaf","date":"2019-06-14 11:25:30 -0700","message":"Added revised copy from rcgenova to feature paragraphs.","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Yishan Lin","author_email":"ylin10@bu.edu","parents":["7cfc92e26f27e506b661b9be95fb0e448e6d906f"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"website/source/docs/enterprise/index.html.md","changes":38,"insertions":13,"deletions":15,"binary":false}],"insertions":18,"deletions":20,"changed":1}},{"hash":"9ab2207003069471c732452149390df168f856ca","date":"2019-06-14 16:30:27 -0500","message":"Emit metrics with raft commit and apply index and statestore latest index","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Preetha Appan","author_email":"preetha@hashicorp.com","parents":["91ee6caba5070ff150d64cf45182e3143e2654e1"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"nomad/server.go","changes":25,"insertions":25,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":25,"deletions":0,"changed":1}},{"hash":"78da9b6ee8df1a9df46da55a4d7f59ac0a882ad0","date":"2019-06-14 15:41:34 -0700","message":"Remove non-UI jobs for branches starting with .-ui (#5839)","refs":[],"body":"Branches that follow the UI naming convention will no longer produce\r\nnon-UI jobs on Travis CI.","author_name":"Buck Doyle","author_email":"buck@hashicorp.com","parents":["91ee6caba5070ff150d64cf45182e3143e2654e1"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":".travis.yml","changes":15,"insertions":15,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":15,"deletions":0,"changed":1}},{"hash":"95adf6127c7a018dea83110406a4e32fae6aa9c5","date":"2019-06-17 12:25:43 -0400","message":"Add a test for unknown variables","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@hashicorp.com","parents":["91ee6caba5070ff150d64cf45182e3143e2654e1"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"helper/pluginutils/hclutils/util_test.go","changes":47,"insertions":32,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":47,"deletions":0,"changed":1}},{"hash":"9ebf0a76454793906eb98287a892f7b982432299","date":"2019-06-17 12:28:14 -0400","message":"Upgrade hcl2 to validate arrays for unknown values","refs":[],"body":"This upgrades hcl2 library dependency to pick up\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/hcl2/pull/113 .\n\nPrior to this change, parsing and decoding array attributes containing\ninvalid errors (e.g. references to unknown variables) are silently\ndropped, with `cty.Unknown` being assigned to the bad element.

A heavily-used client may launch thousands of allocs on startup\nand get killed.\n\nThe bug is that an alloc runner that gets destroyed due to GC remains in\nclient alloc runner set.  Periodically, they get persisted until alloc is\ngced by server.  During that  time, the client db will contain the alloc\nbut not its individual tasks status nor completed state.  On client restart,\nclient assumes that alloc is pending state and re-runs it.\n\nHere, we fix it by ensuring that destroyed alloc runners don't persist any alloc\nto the state DB.\n\nThis is a short-term fix, as we should consider revamping client state\nmanagement.  Storing alloc and task information in non-transaction non-atomic\nconcurrently while alloc runner is running and potentially changing state is a\nrecipe for bugs.\n\nFixes https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/5984\nRelated to https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/5890\n","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@hashicorp.com","parents":["b4a80a7eea58f8932a4f6e4b81e5ddd93781e20e"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"client/allocrunner/alloc_runner.go","changes":18,"insertions":10,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"client/allocrunner/alloc_runner_test.go","changes":58,"insertions":33,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"client/client.go","changes":3,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":78,"deletions":1,"changed":3}},{"hash":"eb5160427f446cfc8251ad8d3f746ad1893ee156","date":"2019-08-26 10:08:14 -0400","message":"Merge pull request #6204 from hashicorp/c-circleci-tweaks-20190824","refs":[],"body":"ci: use circleci/golang images directly","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@hashicorp.com","parents":["b4a80a7eea58f8932a4f6e4b81e5ddd93781e20e","b6bf83ad72d427b108a7c9a85aab17d4e0bea0ba"]},{"hash":"7c1fe3eae5f1f9744f730a049c1318d697e51bea","date":"2019-08-26 10:10:20 -0400","message":"logmon: log stat error to help debugging","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@hashicorp.com","parents":["cc3da4a441968404dde88335fbee51e2affdfe5e"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"client/logmon/logmon.go","changes":4,"insertions":3,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":3,"deletions":1,"changed":1}},{"hash":"3d9e44d40f4fbde1e8f99617799df096a4f060a3","date":"2019-08-26 07:29:08 -0700","message":"Update middleman-hashicorp container (#6185)","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Nick Fagerlund","author_email":"nick@hashicorp.com","parents":["eb5160427f446cfc8251ad8d3f746ad1893ee156"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"website/Gemfile","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"website/Gemfile.lock","changes":26,"insertions":12,"deletions":14,"binary":false},{"file":"website/Makefile","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":14,"deletions":16,"changed":3}},{"hash":"925eed89c69ecd1f984d8e422e71650e2525ba75","date":"2019-08-26 10:52:51 -0400","message":"Merge pull request #6205 from hashicorp/b-no-golang-29119-workaround","refs":[],"body":"logmon: revert workaround for Windows go1.11 bug","author_name":"Mahmood Ali","author_email":"mahmood@hashicorp.com","parents":["3d9e44d40f4fbde1e8f99617799df096a4f060a3","7c1fe3eae5f1f9744f730a049c1318d697e51bea"]},{"hash":"8066f9b8f0326c43c2ef354c609fdb1c195c4edc","date":"2019-08-26 17:01:49 +0200","message":"Merge pull request #6181 from hashicorp/dani/scheduler-vol-ro","refs":[],"body":"scheduler: Implicit constraint on readonly hostvol","author_name":"Danielle","author_email":"dani@hashicorp.com","parents":["925eed89c69ecd1f984d8e422e71650e2525ba75","41292055de1260cda54f6e8a22718672cb7cc375"]},{"hash":"ff3dedd5346fa5b7737a33a19d838d8e928430cf","date":"2019-08-26 13:45:58 -0400","message":"Write to client store while holding lock","refs":[],"body":"Protect against a race where destroying and persist state goroutines\nrace.\n\nThe downside is that the database io operation will run while holding\nthe lock and may run indefinitely.
