500 error from a non-existent `self` endpoint with a response of a\r\n`null` `AccessorID` - which makes sense (a null AccessorID means old\r\nAPI)\r\n\r\nWe then redirect the user to the old ACL pages which then gives a 403\r\nif their token was wrong which then redirects them back to the login page.\r\n\r\nDue to the multiple redirects and not wanting to test the validity of the token\r\nbefore redirecting (thus calling the same API endpoint twice), it is not\r\nstraightforwards to turn the 'faked' response from the `self` endpoint\r\ninto an error (flash messages are 'lost' through multiple redirects).\r\n\r\nIn order to make this a slightly better experience, you can now return a\r\n`false` during execution of an action requiring success/failure\r\nfeedback, this essentially skips the

fixes a bug were registering an agent with a non-existent ACL token can prevent other \r\nservices registered with a good token from being synced to the server when using \r\n`acl_enforce_version_8 = false`.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWhen `acl_enforce_version_8` is off the agent does not check the ACL token validity before \r\nstoring the service in its state.\r\nWhen syncing a service registered with a missing ACL token we fall into the default error \r\nhandling case (https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/master/agent/local/state.go#L1255)\r\nand stop the sync (https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/master/agent/local/state.go#L1082)\r\nwithout setting its Synced property to true like in the permission denied case.\r\nThis means that the sync will always stop at the faulty service(s).\r\nThe order in which the services are synced is random since we iterate on a map. So eventually\r\nall services with good ACL tokens will be synced, this can however take some time and is influenced \r\nby the cluster size, the bigger the slower because retries are less frequent.\r\nHaving a service in this state also prevent all further sync of checks as they are done after\r\nthe services.\r\n\r\n## Changes \r\n\r\nThis change modify the sync process to continue even if there is an error. \r\nThis fixes the issue described above as well as making the sync more error tolerant: if the server repeatedly refuses\r\na service (the ACL token could have been deleted by the time the service is synced, the servers \r\nwere upgraded to a newer version that has more strict checks on the service definition...). \r\nThen all services and check that can be synced will, and those that don't will be marked as errors in \r\nthe logs instead of blocking the whole process.\r\n","author_name":"Aestek","author_email":"thib.gilles@gmail.com","parents":["fde5d75c6846566853ba45788514dc9fd6b07313"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"agent/local/state.go","changes":10,"insertions":5,"deletions":5,"binary":false}],"insertions":5,"deletions":5,"changed":1}},{"hash":"57b5a1de0c5430ae881e4bd941731ec729f27dc9","date":"2019-01-04

This **does not** wire this up in any way to Consul itself, so this will not enable using these plugins yet. \r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nWe want to enable CA providers to be pluggable without modifying Consul so that any CA or PKI system can potentially back the Connect certificates. This CA system may also be used in the future for easier bootstrapping and internal cluster security.\r\n\r\n### go-plugin\r\n\r\nThe benefit of `go-plugin` is that for the plugin consumer, the fact that the interface implementation is communicating over multi-process RPC is invisible. Internals of Consul will continue to just use `ca.Provider` interface implementations as if they're local. For plugin _authors_, they simply have to implement the interface. The network/transport/process management issues are handled by go-plugin itself.\r\n\r\nThe CA provider plugins support both `net/rpc` and gRPC transports. This enables easy authoring in any language. go-plugin handles the actual protocol handshake and connection. This is just a feature of go-plugin. \r\n\r\n`go-plugin` is already in production use for years by Packer, Terraform, Nomad, Vault, and Sentinel. We've shown stability for both desktop and server-side software. It is very mature.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### `map[string]interface{}`\r\n\r\nThe `Configure` method passes a `map[string]interface{}`. This map contains only Go primitives and containers of primitives (no funcs, chans, etc.). For `net/rpc` we encode as-is using Gob. For gRPC we marshal to JSON and transmit as a `bytes` type. This is the same approach we take with Vault and other software.\r\n\r\nNote that this is just the transport protocol, the end software views it fully decoded.\r\n\r\n### `x509.Certificate` and `CertificateRequest`\r\n\r\nWe transmit the raw ASN.1  bytes and decode on the other side. Unit tests are verifying we get the same cert/csrs across the wire.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n`go-plugin` exposes test helpers that enable testing the full plugin RPC over real loopback network connections. We test all endpoints for success and error for both `net/rpc` and gRPC.\r\n\r\n### Vendoring\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't introduce vendoring for two reasons:\r\n\r\n  1. @banks's `f-envoy` branch introduces a lot of these and I didn't want conflict.\r\n  2. The library isn't actually used yet so it doesn't introduce compile-time errors (it does introduce test errors).\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\nWith this in place, we need to figure out the proper way to actually hook these up to Consul, load them, etc. This discussion can happen elsewhere, since regardless of approach this plugin library implementation is the exact same.","author_name":"Mitchell Hashimoto","author_email":"xmitchx@gmail.com","parents":["3841e9e396685846d89f1f29459c5ae4b185038a"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"GNUmakefile","changes":8,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/mock_Provider.go","changes":214,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/plugin/client.go","changes":18,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/plugin/plugin.go","changes":41,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/plugin/plugin_test.go","changes":311,"insertions":3,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/plugin/provider.pb.go","changes":2923,"insertions":27,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/plugin/provider.proto","changes":84,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/plugin/serve.go","changes":33,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/plugin/transport_grpc.go","changes":210,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/plugin/transport_netrpc.go","changes":185,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/connect/ca/provider.go","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":4027,"deletions":2,"changed":11}},{"hash":"516ba47609610bb9510bff1df6dd9133d8eed8be","date":"2018-12-06 12:17:35 -0700","message":"website: fix carousel bugs","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"RJ Spiker","author_email":"spiker.rj@gmail.com","parents":["f76022fa63ed075ad84d75abc49753ee3e244cb1"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"website/source/assets/javascripts/application.js","changes":5,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../assets/javascripts/consul-connect/carousel.js","changes":87,"insertions":12,"deletions":10,"binary":false},{"file":"website/source/configuration.html.erb","changes":9,"insertions":1,"deletions":2,"binary":false},{"file":"website/source/discovery.html.erb","changes":9,"insertions":1,"deletions":2,"binary":false}],"insertions":58,"deletions":52,"changed":4}},{"hash":"8709213d6ed13d0f5ccd3e2c4523ee0a5be5b9f8","date":"2019-01-07 19:53:03 +0100","message":"Prevent status flap when re-registering a check (#4904)","refs":[],"body":"Fixes point `#2` of: https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/4903\r\n\r\nWhen registering a service each healthcheck status is saved and restored (https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/master/agent/agent.go#L1914) to avoid unnecessary flaps in health state.\r\nThis change extends this feature to single check registration by moving this protection in `AddCheck()` so that both `PUT /v1/agent/service/register` and `PUT /v1/agent/check/register` behave in the same idempotent way.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n1.

Clients that do protect against this get updates later than they should because of the backoff time they implement between requests.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nWhile reducing the number of unnecessary updates we still want :\r\n* Clients to be notified as soon as when the last instance of a service disapears.\r\n* Clients to be notified whenever there's there is an update for the service.\r\n* Clients to be notified as soon as the first instance of the requested service is added.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the number of unnecessary updates we need to block when a request to a missing service is made. However in the following case :\r\n\r\n1. Client `client1` makes a query for service `foo`, gets back a node and X-Consul-Index 42\r\n2. `foo` is unregistered \r\n3. `client1`  makes a query for `foo` with `index=42` -> `foo` does not exist, the query blocks and `client1` is not notified of the change on `foo` \r\n\r\nWe could store the last raft index when each service was last alive to know wether we should block on the incoming query or not, but that list could grow indefinetly. \r\nWe instead store the last raft index when a service was unregistered and use it when a query targets a service that does not exist. \r\nWhen a service `srv` is unregistered this \"missing service index\" is always greater than any X-Consul-Index held by the clients while `srv` was up, allowing us to immediatly notify them.\r\n\r\n1. Client `client1` makes a query for service `foo`, gets back a node and `X-Consul-Index: 42`\r\n2. `foo` is unregistered, we set the \"missing service index\" to 43 \r\n3. `client1` makes a blocking query for `foo` with `index=42` -> `foo` does not exist, we check against the \"missing service index\" and return immediatly with `X-Consul-Index: 43`\r\n4. `client1` makes a blocking query for `foo` with `index=43` -> we block\r\n5.

It looks like this isn't the case.\r\n\r\nTurns out sometimes they are encoded sometimes they aren't. It's complicated.\r\nIf at all possible refer to the PR https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/5206.\r\n\r\nIt's related to the difference between `dynamic` routes and `wildcard` routes.\r\n\r\nPartly related to this is a decision on whether we urlencode the slashes within service names or not. Whilst historically we haven't done this, we feel its a good time to change this behaviour, so we'll also be changing services to use dynamic routes instead of wildcard routes. So service links will then look like /ui/dc-1/services/application%2Fservice rather than /ui/dc-1/services/application/service\r\n\r\nHere, we define our routes in a declarative format (for the moment at least JSON) outside of Router.map, and loop through this within Router.map to set all our routes using the standard this.route method. We essentially configure our Router from the outside. As this configuration is now done declaratively outside of Router.map we can also make this data available to href-to and paramsFor, allowing us to detect wildcard routes and therefore apply urlencoding/decoding.\r\n\r\nWhere I mention 'conditionally' below, this is detection is what is used for the decision.\r\n\r\nWe conditionally add url encoding to the `{{href-to}}` helper/addon. The\r\nreasoning here is, if we are asking for a 'href/url' then whatever we\r\nreceive back should always be urlencoded. We've done this by reusing as much\r\ncode from the original `ember-href-to` addon as possible, after this\r\nchange every call to the `{{href-to}}` helper will be urlencoded.\r\n\r\nAs all links using `{{href-to}}` are now properly urlencoded. We also\r\nneed to decode them in the correct place 'on the other end', so..\r\n\r\nWe also override the default `Route.paramsFor` method to conditionally decode all\r\nparams before passing them to the `Route.model` hook.\r\n\r\nLastly (the revert), as we almost consistently use url params to\r\nconstruct API calls, we make sure we re-encode any slugs that have been\r\npassed in by the user/developer. The original API for the `createURL`\r\nfunction was to allow you to pass values that didn't need encoding,\r\nvalues that **did** need encoding, followed by query params (which again\r\nrequire url encoding)\r\n\r\nAll in all this should make the entire ember app url encode/decode safe.\r\n","author_name":"John Cowen","author_email":"johncowen@users.noreply.github.com","parents":["8f0d622a547d440110692a71c4f43a524327e6bc"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"ui-v2/app/adapters/application.js","changes":3,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/adapters/service.js","changes":7,"insertions":0,"deletions":2,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/helpers/href-to.js","changes":31,"insertions":6,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/initializers/route-urldecode-params.js","changes":32,"insertions":6,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/router.js","changes":118,"insertions":14,"deletions":7,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/templates/dc/kv/index.hbs","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/utils/createURL.js","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/utils/routing/walk.js","changes":80,"insertions":14,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/utils/routing/wildcard.js","changes":12,"insertions":3,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/tests/acceptance/dc/kvs/update.feature","changes":22,"insertions":2,"deletions":2,"binary":false},{"file":".../dc/services/show-with-slashes.feature","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/tests/pages/dc/kv/edit.js","changes":9,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/tests/unit/utils/routing/walk-test.js","changes":37,"insertions":7,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/tests/unit/utils/routing/wildcard-test.js","changes":25,"insertions":5,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":321,"deletions":61,"changed":14}},{"hash":"a35fe7c5ba7bf537d2dfd540a7cee4e25ba6e980","date":"2019-01-23 13:51:36 +0000","message":"ui: Removes delete button form pages that show your current token (#5241)","refs":[],"body":"Tokens can no longer delete themselves see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/5210\r\n\r\n...so we remove the button to allow you to do that from the UI","author_name":"John Cowen","author_email":"johncowen@users.noreply.github.com","parents":["c8386ec0cc18acaa2a0588ed9e55f9b15f78d253"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"ui-v2/app/templates/dc/acls/tokens/-form.hbs","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"ui-v2/app/templates/dc/acls/tokens/index.hbs","changes":5,"insertions":1,"deletions":2,"binary":false},{"file":".../dc/acls/tokens/own-no-delete.feature","changes":37,"insertions":22,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../steps/dc/acls/tokens/own-no-delete-steps.js","changes":10,"insertions":6,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":49,"deletions":5,"changed":4}},{"hash":"3a0b0b2b6545e8555607dfd36c91a1b138ac75d7","date":"2019-01-23 13:57:07 +0000","message":"Update CHANGELOG.md","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"John Cowen","author_email":"johncowen@users.noreply.github.com","parents":["a35fe7c5ba7bf537d2dfd540a7cee4e25ba6e980"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"CHANGELOG.md","changes":1,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"changed":1}},{"hash":"f0e081bf88e91b88b1398b27bf75549c1b0cb4d1","date":"2019-01-23 15:12:41 +0100","message":"Fix repeating wording in sentence (#5256)","refs":[],"body":"Fix `to join to join` typo","author_name":"Diogenes S.

This was because the sidecar service was being created without any tags. You could instead make your config look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"services\": [\r\n      \"name\": \"foo\",\r\n      \"port\": 8080,\r\n      \"connect\": { \"sidecar_service\": {\r\n         \"tags\": [\"tag\"]\r\n      } },\r\n      \"tags\": [\"tag\"]\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever that is a bit redundant for most cases. This PR ensures that the tags and service meta of the parent service get copied to the sidecar service. If there are any tags or service meta set in the sidecar service definition then this copying does not take place. After the changes, the query will now return the expected results.\r\n\r\nA second change was made to prepared queries in this PR which is to allow filtering on ServiceMeta just like we allow for filtering on NodeMeta.","author_name":"Matt Keeler","author_email":"mkeeler@users.noreply.github.com","parents":["6e83f68637a719fbbbac69a5ddfcf21eda09ad79"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"agent/agent_test.go","changes":78,"insertions":22,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/consul/prepared_query_endpoint.go","changes":15,"insertions":5,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/consul/prepared_query_endpoint_test.go","changes":68,"insertions":18,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/prepared_query_endpoint_test.go","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/sidecar_service.go","changes":15,"insertions":5,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/sidecar_service_test.go","changes":41,"insertions":12,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"agent/structs/prepared_query.go","changes":5,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"api/prepared_query.go","changes":5,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"api/prepared_query_test.go","changes":6,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"website/source/api/query.html.md","changes":10,"insertions":2,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":".../source/docs/connect/proxies/sidecar-service.md","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":242,"deletions":5,"changed":11}},{"hash":"577b57b3ea0f079b190101733b1b36f353899f26","date":"2019-02-04 09:39:47 -0500","message":"Update CHANGELOG.md","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Matt Keeler","author_email":"mkeeler@users.noreply.github.com","parents":["acfd87c673db383f9b95f75860a9d1b913ec51d5"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"CHANGELOG.md","changes":4,"insertions":4,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":4,"deletions":0,"changed":1}},{"hash":"de50bc3295c9d38c0fce0ec4688a4aa3c7848fcf","date":"2019-02-04 15:16:15 -0600","message":"cli: fix typo in help text for 'consul acl role read' (#5311)","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"R.B.

Tokens set in configuration files are now reloadable.\r\n2. If `acl.enable_token_persistence` is set to `true` in the configuration, tokens set via the `v1/agent/token` endpoint are now persisted to disk and loaded when the agent starts (or during configuration reload)\r\n\r\nNote that token persistence is opt-in so our users who do not want tokens on the local disk will see no change.\r\n\r\nSome other secondary changes:\r\n\r\n* Refactored a bunch of places where the replication token is retrieved from the token store. This token isn't just for replicating ACLs and now it is named accordingly.\r\n* Allowed better paths in the `v1/agent/token/` API. Instead of paths like: `v1/agent/token/acl_replication_token` the path can now be just `v1/agent/token/replication`. The old paths remain to be valid. \r\n* Added a couple new API functions to set tokens via the new paths. Deprecated the old ones and pointed to the new names. The names are also generally better and don't imply that what you are setting is for ACLs but rather are setting ACL tokens.

alternative singleflighting\r\n\r\nSwitches acl resolution to use golang.org/x/sync/singleflight. For the\r\nidentity/legacy lookups this is a drop-in replacement with the same\r\noverall approach to request coalescing.\r\n\r\nFor policies this is technically a change in behavior, but when\r\nconsidered holistically is approximately performance neutral (with the\r\nbenefit of less code).\r\n\r\nThere are two goals with this blob of code (speaking specifically of\r\npolicy resolution here):\r\n\r\n  1) Minimize cross-DC requests.\r\n  2) Minimize client-to-server LAN requests.\r\n\r\nThe previous iteration of this code was optimizing for the case of many\r\npossibly different tokens being resolved concurrently that have a\r\nsignificant overlap in linked policies such that deduplication would be\r\nworth the complexity. While this is laudable there are some things to\r\nconsider that can help to adjust expectations:\r\n\r\n  1) For v1.4+ policies are always replicated, and once a single policy\r\n  shows up in a secondary DC the replicated data is considered\r\n  authoritative for requests made in that DC. This means that our\r\n  earlier concerns about minimizing cross-DC requests are irrelevant\r\n  because there will be no cross-DC policy reads that occur.\r\n\r\n  2) For Server nodes the in-memory ACL policy cache is capped at zero,\r\n  meaning it has no caching. Only Client nodes run with a cache. This\r\n  means that instead of having an entire DC's worth of tokens (what a\r\n  Server might see) that can have policy resolutions coalesced these\r\n  nodes will only ever be seeing node-local token resolutions. In a\r\n  reasonable worst-case scenario where a scheduler like Kubernetes has\r\n  \"filled\" a node with Connect services, even that will only schedule\r\n  ~100 connect services per node. If every service has a unique token\r\n  there will only be 100 tokens to coalesce and even then those requests\r\n  have to occur concurrently AND be hitting an empty consul cache.\r\n\r\nInstead of seeing a great coalescing opportunity for cutting down on\r\nredundant Policy resolutions, in practice it's far more likely given\r\nnode densities that you'd see requests for the same token concurrently\r\nthan you would for two tokens sharing a policy concurrently (to a degree\r\nthat would warrant the overhead of the current variation of\r\nsingleflighting.\r\n\r\nGiven that, this patch switches the Policy resolution process to only\r\nsingleflight by requesting token (but keeps the cache as by-policy).","author_name":"R.B.

Filter Expressions take the general form of:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<selector> == <value>\r\n<selector> != <value>\r\n<value> in <selector>\r\n<value> not in <selector>\r\n<selector> contains <value>\r\n<selector> not contains <value>\r\n<selector> is empty\r\n<selector> is not empty\r\nnot <other expression>\r\n<expression 1> and <expression 2>\r\n<expression 1> or <expression 2>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNormal boolean logic and precedence is supported.

Separate searching off from filtering. 'Searching' can be thought of\nas specifically 'text searching' whilst filtering is more of a\nboolean/flag search.\n2. Decouple the actual searching functionality to almost pure,\nisolated / unit testable units and unit test. (I still import embers get\nwhich, once I upgrade to 3.5, I shouldn't need)\n3. Searching rules are now configurable from the outside, i.e. not\nwrapped in Controllers or Components.\n4. General searching itself now can use an asynchronous approach based on\nevents. This prepares for future possibilities of handing off the\nsearching to a web worker or elsewhere, which should aid in large scale\nsearching and prepares the way for other searching methods.\n5. Adds the possibility of have multiple searches in one\ntemplate/route/page.\n\nAdditionally, this adds a WithSearching mixin to aid linking the\nsearching to ember in an ember-like way in a single place. Plus a\nWithListeners mixin to aid with cleaning up of event listeners on\nController/Component destruction.\n\nPost-initial work I slightly changed the API of create listeners:\n\nReturning the handler from a `remover` means you can re-add it again if you\nwant to, this avoids having to save a reference to the handler elsewhere\nto do the same.\n\nThe `remove` method itself now returns an array of handlers, again you\nmight want to use these again or something, and its also more useful\nthen just returning an empty array.\n\nThe more I look at this the more I doubt that you'll ever use `remove`\nto remove individual handlers, you may aswell just use the `remover`\nreturned from add. I've added some comments to reflect this, but they'll\nlikely be removed once I'm absolutely sure of this.\n\nI also added some comments for WithSearching to explain possible further\nwork re: moving `searchParams` so it can be `hung` off the\ncontroller object\n","author_name":"John

Whilst running into point 1 here, we managed to make the blocking\r\nqueries eternally loop.

13:36:56 -0500","message":"agent: fix several data races and bugs related to node-local alias checks (#5876)","refs":[],"body":"The observed bug was that a full restart of a consul datacenter (servers\r\nand clients) in conjunction with a restart of a connect-flavored\r\napplication with bring-your-own-service-registration logic would very\r\nfrequently cause the envoy sidecar service check to never reflect the\r\naliased service.\r\n\r\nOver the course of investigation several bugs and unfortunate\r\ninteractions were corrected:\r\n\r\n(1)\r\n\r\nlocal.CheckState objects were only shallow copied, but the key piece of\r\ndata that gets read and updated is one of the things not copied (the\r\nunderlying Check with a Status field). When the stock code was run with\r\nthe race detector enabled this highly-relevant-to-the-test-scenario field\r\nwas found to be racy.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n a) update the existing Clone method to include the Check field\r\n b) copy-on-write when those fields need to change rather than\r\n    incrementally updating them in place.\r\n\r\nThis made the observed behavior occur slightly less often.\r\n\r\n(2)\r\n\r\nIf anything about how the runLocal method for node-local alias check\r\nlogic was ever flawed, there was no fallback option. Those checks are\r\npurely edge-triggered and failure to properly notice a single edge\r\ntransition would leave the alias check incorrect until the next flap of\r\nthe aliased check.\r\n\r\nThe change was to introduce a fallback timer to act as a control loop to\r\ndouble check the alias check matches the aliased check every minute\r\n(borrowing the duration from the non-local alias check logic body).\r\n\r\nThis made the observed behavior eventually go away when it did occur.\r\n\r\n(3)\r\n\r\nOriginally I thought there were two main actions involved in the data race:\r\n\r\nA. The act of adding the original check (from disk recovery) and its\r\n   first health evaluation.\r\n\r\nB. The act of the HTTP API requests coming in and resetting the local\r\n   state when re-registering the same services and checks.\r\n\r\nIt took awhile for me to realize that there's a third action at work:\r\n\r\nC. The goroutines associated with the original check and the later\r\n   checks.\r\n\r\nThe actual sequence of actions that was causing the bad behavior was\r\nthat the API actions result in the original check to be removed and\r\nre-added _without waiting for the original goroutine to terminate_. This\r\nmeans for brief windows of time during check definition edits there are\r\ntwo goroutines that can be sending updates for the alias check status.\r\n\r\nIn extremely unlikely scenarios the original goroutine sees the aliased\r\ncheck start up in `critical` before being removed but does not get the\r\nnotification about the nearly immediate update of that check to\r\n`passing`.\r\n\r\nThis is interlaced wit the new goroutine coming up, initializing its\r\nbase case to `passing` from the current state and then listening for new\r\nnotifications of edge triggers.\r\n\r\nIf the original goroutine \"finishes\" its update, it then commits one\r\nmore write into the local state of `critical` and exits leaving the\r\nalias check no longer reflecting the underlying check.\r\n\r\nThe correction here is to enforce that the old goroutines must terminate\r\nbefore spawning the new one for alias checks.\r\n","author_name":"R.B.

We pass this value down to ember by overwriting the ember\r\nconfig that is injected via a <meta> tag. This has to be done before\r\nember bootup.\r\n\r\nSometimes (during testing and development, basically not production)\r\nthis is injected with the already existing value, in which case this\r\nessentially changes nothing.\r\n\r\nThe code here is slightly abstracted away from our specific usage to\r\nmake it easier for anyone else to use, and also make sure we can cope\r\nwith using this same method to pass variables down from the CLI through\r\nto ember in the future.\r\n\r\n* ui: We can't use <base /> move everything to javascript (#5941)\r\n\r\nUnfortuantely we can't seem to be able to use <base> and rootURL\r\ntogether as URL paths will get doubled up (`ui/ui/`).\r\n\r\nThis moves all the things that we need to interpolate with .ContentPath\r\nto the `startup` javascript so we can conditionally print out\r\n`{{.ContentPath}}` in lots of places (now we can't use base)\r\n\r\n* fixed when we serve index.html\r\n\r\n* ui: For writing a ContentPath, we also need to cope with testing...

Previously the `sed` replacement was searching for the CONSUL_VERSION\r\ncomment at the start of a line, it no longer does this to allow for\r\nindentation.\r\n2. Both `grep` and `sed` where looking for the omment at the end of the\r\nline. We've removed this restriction here. We don't need to remove it\r\nright now, but if we ever put the comment followed by something here the\r\nsearching would break.\r\n3. Added `xargs` for trimming the resulting version string. We aren't\r\nusing this already in the rest of the scripts, but we are pretty sure\r\nthis is available on most systems.\r\n\r\n* ui: Fix erroneous variable, and also force an ember cache clean on build\r\n\r\n1. We referenced a variable incorrectly here, this fixes that.\r\n2. We also made sure that every `make` target clears ember's `tmp` cache\r\nto ensure that its not using any caches that have since been edited\r\neverytime we call a `make` target.\r\n\r\n* added docs, fixed encoding\r\n\r\n* fixed go fmt\r\n\r\n* Update agent/config/config.go\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: R.B.

This only matters when envoy is in \"panic mode\"\r\naka \"when you have a bunch of unhealthy endpoints\". Panic mode sends\r\ntraffic to unhealthy instances in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nNote: Prior to explicitly disabling the healthy panic threshold, the\r\ndefault value is 50%.\r\n\r\nWhat was happening is that the test harness was bringing up consul the\r\nsidecars, and the service instances all at once and sometimes the\r\nproxies wouldn't have time to be checked by consul to be labeled as\r\n'passing' in the catalog before a round of EDS happened.\r\n\r\nThe xDS server in consul effectively queries /v1/health/connect/s2 and\r\ngets 1 result, but that one result has a 'critical' check so the xDS\r\nserver sends back that endpoint labeled as UNHEALTHY.\r\n\r\nEnvoy sees that 100% of the endpoints in the cluster are unhealthy and\r\nwould enter panic mode and still send traffic to s2. This is why the\r\ntest suites PRIOR to disabling the healthy panic threshold worked. They\r\nwere _incorrectly_ passing.\r\n\r\nWhen the healthy panic threshol is disabled, envoy never enters panic\r\nmode in this situation and thus the cluster has zero healthy endpoints\r\nso load balancing goes nowhere and the tests fail.\r\n\r\nWhy does this only affect the test suites for envoy 1.8.0?

As soon as it can it will initialize the secondary CA by pulling the primaries roots and getting the primary to sign an intermediate.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a segfault that can happen during leadership revocation. There was a spot in the secondaryCARootsWatch that was getting the CA Provider and executing methods on it without nil checking. Under normal circumstances it wont be nil but during leadership revocation it gets nil'ed out. Therefore there is a period of time between closing the stop chan and when the go routine is actually stopped where it could read a nil provider and cause a segfault.\r\n","author_name":"Matt

Envoy currently only lets you configure the outbound SNI\r\nheader at the cluster layer.\r\n\r\nIf you try to failover through a mesh gateway you ideally would\r\nconfigure the SNI value per endpoint, but that's not possible in envoy\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a simpler way around the problem for now:\r\n\r\n1. We identify any target of failover that will use mesh gateway mode local or\r\n   remote and then further isolate any resolver node in the compiled discovery\r\n   chain that has a failover destination set to one of those targets.\r\n\r\n2. For each of these resolvers we will perform a small measurement of\r\n   comparative healths of the endpoints that come back from the health API for the\r\n   set of primary target and serial failover targets. We walk the list of targets\r\n   in order and if any endpoint is healthy we return that target, otherwise we\r\n   move on to the next target.\r\n\r\n3. The CDS and EDS endpoints both perform the measurements in (2) for the\r\n   affected resolver nodes.\r\n\r\n4. For CDS this measurement selects which TLS SNI field to use for the cluster\r\n   (note the cluster is always going to be named for the primary target)\r\n\r\n5. For EDS this measurement selects which set of endpoints will populate the\r\n   cluster. Priority tiered failover is ignored.\r\n\r\nOne of the big downsides to this approach to failover is that the failover\r\ndetection and correction is going to be controlled by consul rather than\r\ndeferring that entirely to the data plane as with the prior version. This also\r\nmeans that we are bound to only failover using official health signals and\r\ncannot make use of data plane signals like outlier detection to affect\r\nfailover.\r\n\r\nIn this specific scenario the lack of data plane signals is ok because the\r\neffectiveness is already muted by the fact that the ultimate destination\r\nendpoints will have their data plane signals scrambled when they pass through\r\nthe mesh gateway wrapper anyway so we're not losing much.\r\n\r\nAnother related fix is that we now use the endpoint health from the\r\nunderlying service, not the health of the gateway (regardless of\r\nfailover mode).","author_name":"R.B.

So it's time\r\nfor a new container.\r\n\r\nAs with last time, here's a reminder for the next person who needs to update\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n- You shouldn't just update the dependency in Gemfile.lock, because your build\r\n  times will go to heck as you compile Nokogiri from source on every run. So you\r\n  need an updated container with all the dependencies.\r\n- To update the container, you need to push a new tag to the middleman-hashicorp\r\n  repo. Teamcity does the rest, and will ship a new container to Docker Hub\r\n  (unless its credentials are out of date, in which case go ask team-eng-serv.)\r\n- Once that's pushed:\r\n    - Update Makefile\r\n    - Update the Gemfile\r\n    - Delete Gemfile.lock\r\n    - `make website` until it comes up, then ctrl-C\r\n    - Commit the changes\r\n\r\n* website: Specify a different json version in Gemfile.lock\r\n\r\nThe Consul website uses different containers for preview and deploy, and this\r\noddball JSON version was causing issues.
