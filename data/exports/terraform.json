In particular, we can recognize a reference like\naws_instance.foo.count, which in 0.11 and prior was a weird special case\nfor determining the count value of a resource block, and offer a helpful\nerror showing the new length(aws_instance.foo) usage pattern.\n\nThis eventually delegates to the static traversal validation logic that\nwas added to the configschema package in a previous commit, which also\nincludes some specialized error messages that distinguish between\nattributes and block types in the schema so that the errors relate more\ndirectly to constructs the user can see in the configuration.\n\nIn future we could potentially move more of the checks from the dynamic\nschema construction step to the static validation step, but resources\nare the reference type that most needs this immediately due to the\nambiguity caused by the instance indexing syntax. We can safely refactor\nother reference types to be statically validated in later releases.\n\nThis is verified by two pre-existing context validate tests which we\ntemporarily disabled during earlier work (now re-enabled) and also by a\nnew validate test aimed specifically at the special case for the \"count\"\nattribute.\n","author_name":"Martin

list brackets around a single string was the\nsignal to split the string on a special uuid separator to produce a list\njust in time for processing, giving expressions like this:\n\n    foo = [\"${test_instance.foo.*.id}\"]\n\nLogically this is weird because it looks like it should produce a list\nof lists of strings. When we added real list support in Terraform 0.7 we\nretained support for this behavior by trimming off extra levels of list\nduring evaluation, and inadvertently continued relying on this notation\nfor correct type checking.\n\nDuring the Terraform 0.10 line we fixed the type checker bugs (a few\nremaining issues notwithstanding) so that it was finally possible to\nuse the more intuitive form:\n\n    foo = \"${test_instance.foo.*.id}\"\n\n...but we continued trimming off extra levels of list for backward\ncompatibility.\n\nTerraform 0.12 finally removes that compatibility shim, causing redundant\nlist brackets to be interpreted as a list of lists.\n\nThis upgrade rule attempts to identify situations that are relying on the\nold compatibility behavior and trim off the redundant extra brackets. It's\nnot possible to do this fully-generally using only static analysis, but\nwe can gather enough information through or partial type inference\nmechanism here to deal with the most common situations automatically and\nproduce a TF-UPGRADE-TODO comment for more complex scenarios where the\nuser intent isn't decidable with only static analysis.\n\nIn particular, this handles by far the most common situation of wrapping\nlist brackets around a splat expression like the first example above.\nAfter this and the other upgrade rules are applied, the first example\nabove will become:\n\n    foo = test_instance.foo.*.id\n","author_name":"Martin

altogether, which previously created a chicken/egg problem because\nwe need to install the providers in order to run \"terraform 0.12upgrade\"\nand thus fix the problem.\n\nThis changes \"terraform init\" to use the new \"early configuration\" loader\nfor module and provider installation. This is built on the more permissive\nparser in the terraform-config-inspect package, and so it allows us to\nread out the top-level blocks from the configuration while accepting\nlegacy HCL syntax.\n\nIn the long run this will let us do version compatibility detection before\nattempting a \"real\" config load, giving us better error messages for any\nfuture syntax additions, but in the short term the key thing is that it\nallows us to install the dependencies even if the configuration isn't\nfully valid.\n\nBecause backend init still requires full configuration, this introduces a\nnew mode of terraform init where it detects heuristically if it seems like\nwe need to do a configuration upgrade and does a partial init if so,\nbefore finally directing the user to run \"terraform 0.12upgrade\" before\nrunning any other commands.\n\nThe heuristic here is based on two assumptions:\n- If the \"early\" loader finds no errors but the normal loader does, the\n  configuration is likely to be valid for Terraform 0.11 but not 0.12.\n- If there's already a version constraint in the configuration that\n  excludes Terraform versions prior to v0.12 then the configuration is\n  probably _already_ upgraded and so it's just a normal syntax error,\n  even if the early loader didn't detect it.\n\nOnce the upgrade process is removed in 0.13.0 (users will be required to\ngo stepwise 0.11 -> 0.12 -> 0.13 to upgrade after that), some of this can\nbe simplified to remove that special mode, but the idea of doing the\ndependency version checks against the liberal parser will remain valuable\nto increase our chances of reporting version-based incompatibilities\nrather than syntax errors as we add new features in future.\n","author_name":"Martin

would naturally arise from a\n  computation, such as forcing a string containing digits into a number.\n- Our 0.12upgrade mechanism will use some of these to replace use of the\n  undocumented, hidden type conversion functions in HIL, and force\n  particular type interpretations in some tricky cases.\n- We've found that type conversion functions can be useful as _temporary_\n  workarounds for bugs

This\nwas a bad user experience for anyone who made a typo in a variable name\nand got no feedback about it, so we made this an error for 0.12.\n\nHowever, several users are now relying on the silent-ignore behavior for\nautomation scenarios where they pass the same .tfvars file to all\nconfigurations in their organization and expect Terraform to ignore any\nsettings that are not relevant to a specific configuration. We never\nintentionally supported that, but we don't want to immediately break that\nworkflow during 0.12 upgrade.\n\nAs a compromise, then, we'll make this a warning for v0.12.0 that contains\na deprecation notice suggesting to move to using environment variables\nfor this \"cross-configuration variables\" use-case. We don't produce errors\nfor undeclared variables in environment variables, even though that\npotentially causes the same UX annoyance as ignoring them in vars files,\nbecause environment variables are assumed to live in the user's session\nand this it would be very inconvenient to have to unset such variables\nwhen moving between directories. Their \"ambientness\" makes them a better\nfit for these automatically-assigned general variable values that may or\nmay not be used by a particular configuration.\n\nThis can revert to being an error in a future major release, after users\nhave had the opportunity to migrate their automation solutions over to\nuse environment variables.\n\nWe don't seem to have any tests covering this specific situation right\nnow. That isn't ideal, but this change is so straightforward that it would\nbe relatively expensive to build new targeted test cases for it and so\nI instead just hand-tested that it is indeed now producing a warning where\nwe were previously producing an error.

Now it will fail, allowing automated build\nprocesses to detect it and not produce a broken archive for distribution.\n","author_name":"Martin Atkins","author_email":"mart@degeneration.co.uk","parents":["f00fcb90bfd1df4cf567a503705db08a53ea7a8c"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"tools/terraform-bundle/README.md","changes":9,"insertions":9,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"tools/terraform-bundle/config.go","changes":9,"insertions":8,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"tools/terraform-bundle/main.go","changes":8,"insertions":3,"deletions":5,"binary":false},{"file":"tools/terraform-bundle/package.go","changes":1,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":21,"deletions":6,"changed":4}},{"hash":"e9099b4fcc7b1b84e4bd461e783a4f1be71d10e8","date":"2019-01-23 16:14:34 -0800","message":"command/jsonplan: fix panic when filteredAfter is null (#20096)","refs":[],"body":"* command/jsonplan: fix panic when filteredAfter is null\r\n* command/jsonconfig: provider short name is required to properly look up resource schema\r\n","author_name":"Kristin Laemmert","author_email":"mildwonkey@users.noreply.github.com","parents":["c70954aeabfd5c084f9f15d017e141f9aa1498b7"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"command/jsonconfig/config.go","changes":11,"insertions":5,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"command/jsonconfig/expression_test.go","changes":73,"insertions":35,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"command/jsonplan/plan.go","changes":10,"insertions":3,"deletions":2,"binary":false}],"insertions":89,"deletions":5,"changed":3}},{"hash":"7dd0acc46b345a805420b6b9c91bfd1bf80d7c83","date":"2019-01-23 19:17:10 -0500","message":"don't count empty containers in diff.Apply","refs":[],"body":"If there were no matching keys, and there was no diff at all, don't set\na zero count for the container.

would work with sets because we'd automatically convert them\nto lists on entry to HIL -- with an arbitrary-but-consistent ordering --\nand this return an arbitrary-but-consistent element from the list.\n\nThe element(...) function in Terraform 0.12 does not allow this because it\nis not safe in general, but there was an existing pattern relying on this\nin Terraform 0.11 configs which this upgrade rule is intended to preserve:\n\n    resource \"example\" \"example\" {\n      count = \"${length(any_set_attribute)}\"\n\n      foo = \"${element(any_set_attribute, count.index}\"\n    }\n\nThe above works because the exact indices assigned in the conversion are\nirrelevant: we're just asking Terraform to create one resource for each\ndistinct element in the set.\n\nThis upgrade rule therefore inserts an explicit conversion to list if it\nis able to successfully provide that the given expression will return a\nset type:\n\n    foo = \"${element(tolist(any_set_attribute), count.index}\"\n\nThis makes the conversion explicit, allowing users to decide if it is\nsafe and rework the configuration if not. Since our static type analysis\nfunctionality focuses mainly on resource type attributes, in practice this\nrule will only apply when the given expression is a statically-checkable\nresource reference. Since sets are an SDK-only concept in Terraform 0.11\nand earlier anyway, in practice that works out just right: it's not\npossible for sets to appear anywhere else in older versions anyway.\n","author_name":"Martin

0.12 no\nlonger has this feature and instead requires connection settings to be\nwritten explicitly in terms of the resource's exported attributes. For\ncompatibility though, the upgrade tool will insert expressions that are\nas close as possible to the logic the provider formerly implemented, or\nin a few rare cases a TF-UPGRADE-TODO comment to fix it up manually.\n\nSome of the existing resource type implementations have incredibly\ncomplicated implementations of selecting a single host IP address to use\nand don't expose the result of that as an attribute, so for now we handle\nthose via a complicated Terraform language expression achieving the same\nresult. Ideally these providers would introduce a new attribute that\nexports the same address formerly exported as the hostname before their\ninitial v0.12-compatible release, in which case we can simplify these to\njust reference the attribute in question. That would be preferable also\nbecause it would allow use of that exported attribute in other contexts,\nsuch as in a null_resource provisioner somewhere else or in an output\nto allow a caller to deal with the SSH part itself.\n","author_name":"Martin

appear as a list when count\nis set (so it can be used in other expressions), it's no longer possible\nto have an attribute in that position: lists don't have attributes.\nFortunately we don't really need that special case anymore since it\ndoesn't do anything we can't now do with the length(...) function.\n\nThis upgrade rule, then, detects references like test_instance.foo.count\nand rewrites to length(test_instance.foo). As a special case, if\ntest_instance.foo doesn't have \"count\" set then it just rewrites as the\nconstant 1, which mimics what would've happened in that case in Terraform\n0.11.\n","author_name":"Martin Atkins","author_email":"mart@degeneration.co.uk","parents":["b3cb94a929b41037e7a299bdc29a86614e9626a5"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":".../resource-count-ref/input/resource-count-ref.tf","changes":29,"insertions":17,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../resource-count-ref/want/resource-count-ref.tf","changes":29,"insertions":17,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../valid/resource-count-ref/want/versions.tf","changes":3,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"configs/configupgrade/upgrade_expr.go","changes":38,"insertions":22,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":99,"deletions":0,"changed":4}},{"hash":"929231a2e958372259f1daf95e243bc5ff9ff4bc","date":"2019-02-22 20:16:45 -0500","message":"Merge pull request #20437 from hashicorp/jbardin/ssh-keepalive","refs":[],"body":"add ssh keepalive messages to communicator","author_name":"James Bardin","author_email":"j.bardin@gmail.com","parents":["dd43926761a31932eff31b6a637e975fdd810e21","b5384100a68ef096a6d59a68a4480ff2bddef5b7"]},{"hash":"b217624d83cad75fd7a9eae770ef744b685fdb42","date":"2019-02-22 16:52:11 -0800","message":"config/configupgrade: Test to show that list unwrapping works for sets","refs":[],"body":"This was already working but we had no tests to prove it.\n","author_name":"Martin Atkins","author_email":"mart@degeneration.co.uk","parents":["929231a2e958372259f1daf95e243bc5ff9ff4bc"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"configs/configschema/decoder_spec.go","changes":14,"insertions":9,"deletions":5,"binary":false},{"file":".../valid/redundant-list/input/redundant-list.tf","changes":12,"insertions":12,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../valid/redundant-list/want/redundant-list.tf","changes":12,"insertions":12,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":33,"deletions":5,"changed":3}},{"hash":"830a00b6b8500be0eb0c403d073c7d34cf05cceb","date":"2019-02-22 20:41:37 -0500","message":"fix test that diverged between 2 merges","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"James Bardin","author_email":"j.bardin@gmail.com","parents":["b5384100a68ef096a6d59a68a4480ff2bddef5b7"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"communicator/ssh/communicator_test.go","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"changed":1}},{"hash":"bd28b996dbc0c66d71823da3e2f8429e55252657","date":"2019-02-22 20:55:01 -0500","message":"Merge pull request #20449 from hashicorp/jbardin/ssh-keepalive","refs":[],"body":"fix test that diverged between 2 merges","author_name":"James Bardin","author_email":"j.bardin@gmail.com","parents":["b217624d83cad75fd7a9eae770ef744b685fdb42","830a00b6b8500be0eb0c403d073c7d34cf05cceb"]},{"hash":"9c0e3cc8198e0b55b64dd2f5a590fe095cebd157","date":"2019-02-22 21:00:44 -0500","message":"Merge pull request #20432 from hashicorp/jbardin/s3-prefix-key","refs":[],"body":"s3 workspace_key_prefix","author_name":"James Bardin","author_email":"j.bardin@gmail.com","parents":["bd28b996dbc0c66d71823da3e2f8429e55252657","31ca293777bd85c5844aa0c84457579f5ff6c535"]},{"hash":"552dddfb4ccad40e67c8fb4f4f12d5c7d9364a63","date":"2019-02-22 17:51:48 -0800","message":"command: Specialized error message for var decls in tfvars","refs":[],"body":"A common new-user mistake is to place variable _declarations_ into .tfvars\nfiles instead of variable _values_.

state types, but attempted to partially retain the old-style\n\"StateFilter\" abstraction that originally lived in the Terraform package,\neven though that was no longer being used for any other functionality.\n\nUnfortunately the adaptation of the existing filtering to the new types\nwasn't exact and so these commands ended up having a few bugs that were\nnot covered by the existing tests.\n\nSince the old StateFilter behavior was the source of various misbehavior\nanyway, here it's removed altogether and replaced with some simpler\nfunctions in the state_meta.go file that are tailored to the use-cases of\nthese sub-commands.\n\nAs well as just generally behaving more consistently with the other\nparts of Terraform that use the new resource address types, this commit\nfixes the following bugs:\n\n- A resource address of aws_instance.foo would previously match an\n  resource of that type and name in any module, which disagreed with the\n  expected interpretation elsewhere of meaning a single resource in the\n  root module.\n\n- The \"terraform state mv\" command was not supporting moves from a single\n  resource address to an indexed address and vice-versa, because the old\n  logic didn't need to make that distinction while they are two separate\n  address types in the new logic. Now we allow resources that do not have\n  count/for_each to be treated as if they are instances for the purposes\n  of this command, which is a better match for likely user intent and for\n  the old behavior.\n\nFinally, we also clean up a little some of the usage output from these\ncommands, which hasn't been updated for some time and so had both some\nstale information and some inaccurate terminology.\n","author_name":"Martin Atkins","author_email":"mart@degeneration.co.uk","parents":["04cbf249aabebead12d85efc5609b66f6445deb0"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"command/state_list.go","changes":56,"insertions":3,"deletions":2,"binary":false},{"file":"command/state_meta.go","changes":146,"insertions":9,"deletions":4,"binary":false},{"file":"command/state_mv.go","changes":301,"insertions":19,"deletions":7,"binary":false},{"file":"command/state_mv_test.go","changes":164,"insertions":13,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"command/state_rm.go","changes":102,"insertions":4,"deletions":5,"binary":false},{"file":"command/state_rm_test.go","changes":85,"insertions":7,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"states/state_filter.go","changes":180,"insertions":0,"deletions":16,"binary":false},{"file":"states/state_filter_test.go","changes":516,"insertions":0,"deletions":44,"binary":false}],"insertions":649,"deletions":901,"changed":8}},{"hash":"24e13d8ec106586c673ef227fad45d55416826b3","date":"2019-03-13 12:52:15 -0400","message":"plugin/discovery: Return tfdiags from Get","refs":[],"body":"Allows us to surface warnings to the user using the tfdiags interfaces.\n","author_name":"Justin Campbell","author_email":"justin@justincampbell.me","parents":["f799a133e3c1a8c9756c37287bc646a545edfe89"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"command/init.go","changes":3,"insertions":2,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"command/init_test.go","changes":9,"insertions":5,"deletions":4,"binary":false},{"file":"command/plugins_test.go","changes":16,"insertions":9,"deletions":7,"binary":false},{"file":"plugin/discovery/get.go","changes":32,"insertions":17,"deletions":15,"binary":false},{"file":"plugin/discovery/get_test.go","changes":10,"insertions":5,"deletions":5,"binary":false},{"file":"tools/terraform-bundle/package.go","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":39,"deletions":33,"changed":6}},{"hash":"e6316c9de64409d5bc93527be2f8465da7a74b0e","date":"2019-03-13 12:52:52 -0400","message":"plugin/discovery: Parse warnings from TF Registry","refs":[],"body":"Terraform Registry (and other registry implementations) can now return\nan array of warnings with the versions response.

Providers should use this sparingly only in situations where\nprevailing usage disagrees with the new expectations of Terraform Core in\nv0.12.\n\nThis commit only adds the flag, and does not implement any behavior for it\nyet. That means this commit can exist in both the v0.11 and v0.12\ncodebases, allowing for API compatibility. A subsequent commit for v0.12\n(not included in v0.11) will then implement this behavior.\n","author_name":"Martin Atkins","author_email":"mart@degeneration.co.uk","parents":["1e32ae243c048d058ca8f5d0725aca3bbf4441d3"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"helper/schema/schema.go","changes":42,"insertions":40,"deletions":2,"binary":false}],"insertions":40,"deletions":2,"changed":1}},{"hash":"135121562e2572ec0d08e32a47025cbef9b7e80e","date":"2019-03-21 11:59:53 -0700","message":"helper/plugin: Implement Schema.SkipCoreTypeCheck","refs":[],"body":"The previous commit added this flag but did not implement it.

of using a nested block type to represent a group of\narguments that relate to a particular feature that is always enabled but\nwhere it improves configuration readability to group all of its settings\ntogether in a nested block.\n\nThe existing NestingSingle was not a good fit for this because it is\ndesigned under the assumption that the presence or absence of the block\nhas some significance in enabling or disabling the relevant feature, and\nso for these always-active cases we'd generate a misleading plan where\nthe settings for the feature appear totally absent, rather than showing\nthe default values that will be selected.\n\nNestingGroup is, therefore, a slight variation of NestingSingle where\npresence vs. absence of the block is not distinguishable (it's never null)\nand instead its contents are treated as unset when the block is absent.\nThis then in turn causes any default values associated with the nested\narguments to be honored and displayed in the plan whenever the block is\nnot explicitly configured.\n\nThe current SDK cannot activate this mode, but that's okay because its\n\"legacy type system\" opt-out flag allows it to force a block to be\nprocessed in this way anyway. We're adding this now so that we can\nintroduce the feature in a future SDK without causing a breaking change\nto the protocol, since the set of possible block nesting modes is not\nextensible.\n","author_name":"Martin

This\nmeans that our diff output will now consistently list additions before\nremovals when showing sets, rather than the ordering being undefined as\nbefore.\n\nThe ordering of known, non-null, non-primitive values is still not\ncontractually fixed but remains consistent for a particular version of\ncty.\n","author_name":"Martin Atkins","author_email":"mart@degeneration.co.uk","parents":["4b83ddb025db9eeb560ba48ff0fe2bd5ece39bcf"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"command/format/diff_test.go","changes":12,"insertions":2,"deletions":3,"binary":false},{"file":"go.mod","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"go.sum","changes":4,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"lang/funcs/collection_test.go","changes":6,"insertions":1,"deletions":2,"binary":false},{"file":".../github.com/zclconf/go-cty/cty/set/iterator.go","changes":31,"insertions":2,"deletions":10,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/github.com/zclconf/go-cty/cty/set/ops.go","changes":51,"insertions":11,"deletions":8,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/github.com/zclconf/go-cty/cty/set/rules.go","changes":18,"insertions":7,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../github.com/zclconf/go-cty/cty/set_internals.go","changes":58,"insertions":22,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/modules.txt","changes":2,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false}],"insertions":125,"deletions":59,"changed":9}},{"hash":"fc5b186e8d688c62cdea2fd9ab9ce358d2b21d0a","date":"2019-04-30 23:32:05 -0500","message":"Don't leak so many connections in the pg backend","refs":[],"body":"This change fixes an error I get:\nError: pq: too many connections for role \"asdf\"\nbecause I can only have so many connections.\n","author_name":"Stephen Buergler","author_email":"sixcorners@gmail.com","parents":["6adcc7ab73a4e14e35caee46d8d785814068b425"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"backend/remote-state/pg/backend.go","changes":6,"insertions":3,"deletions":3,"binary":false}],"insertions":3,"deletions":3,"changed":1}},{"hash":"8520f4e4a5a0e9c52b8d7453c2299657da702c74","date":"2019-05-01 10:19:40 -0400","message":"* lang/funcs/flatten: accept sets and tuples, return tuples","refs":[],"body":"* lang/funcs: flatten should handle sets and tuples\r\n\r\n* flatten now returns a tuple\r\n","author_name":"Kristin Laemmert","author_email":"mildwonkey@users.noreply.github.com","parents":["6adcc7ab73a4e14e35caee46d8d785814068b425"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"lang/funcs/collection.go","changes":29,"insertions":21,"deletions":7,"binary":false},{"file":"lang/funcs/collection_test.go","changes":44,"insertions":40,"deletions":3,"binary":false},{"file":"lang/functions_test.go","changes":4,"insertions":2,"deletions":2,"binary":false}],"insertions":65,"deletions":12,"changed":3}},{"hash":"543e279cb096197c94762017088d40bd0888897d","date":"2019-05-01 10:20:57 -0400","message":"Update CHANGELOG.md","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"Kristin Laemmert","author_email":"mildwonkey@users.noreply.github.com","parents":["8520f4e4a5a0e9c52b8d7453c2299657da702c74"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"CHANGELOG.md","changes":1,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"changed":1}},{"hash":"4194eff5da7a23b73834aef54051d32f149da94d","date":"2019-05-01 13:40:50 -0700","message":"guide changes","refs":[],"body":"","author_name":"cgriggs01","author_email":"cgriggs@hashicorp.com","parents":["543e279cb096197c94762017088d40bd0888897d"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"website/guides/terraform-provider-development-program.html.md","changes":4,"insertions":2,"deletions":2,"binary":false}],"insertions":2,"deletions":2,"changed":1}},{"hash":"81e04c3050ec3ccb5ec298f296148d1e111d6739","date":"2019-04-30 13:12:00 -0400","message":"more precise type handling in slice","refs":[],"body":"When slicing a list containing unknown values, the list itself is known,\nand slice should return the proper slice of that list.\n\nMake SliceFunc return the correct type for slices of tuples, and\ndisallow slicing sets.\n","author_name":"James Bardin","author_email":"j.bardin@gmail.com","parents":["543e279cb096197c94762017088d40bd0888897d"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"lang/funcs/collection.go","changes":82,"insertions":27,"deletions":16,"binary":false},{"file":"lang/funcs/collection_test.go","changes":59,"insertions":29,"deletions":2,"binary":false}],"insertions":108,"deletions":33,"changed":2}},{"hash":"93ef015336631f784b1f06c7a9d8372ffbd9f635","date":"2019-05-01 14:22:50 -0400","message":"more precise type handling in flatten","refs":[],"body":"FlattenFunc can return lists and tuples when individual elements are\nunknown.

For AWS operations to work in the new region, the region must be explicitly enabled as outlined in the [previous new region announcement blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-asia-pacific-hong-kong-region/). When the region is not enabled, the Terraform S3 Backend will return errors during credential validation (e.g. `error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid`).\n* backend/s3: After this update, the AWS Go SDK will prefer credentials found via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable when both the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable and the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables are statically defined. Previously the SDK would ignore the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, if static environment credentials were also specified. This is listed as a bug fix in the AWS Go SDK release notes.\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n* backend/s3: Add support for assuming role via web identity token via the `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` and `AWS_ROLE_ARN` environment variables\n* backend/s3: Support automatic region validation for `me-south-1`\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* backend/s3: Load credentials via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable (if available) when `AWS_PROFILE` is defined along with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\n```\n\nUpdated via:\n\n```\ngo get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.21.7\ngo mod tidy\ngo mod vendor\n```\n\nVerification with this update:\n\n```hcl\nterraform {\n  backend \"s3\" {\n    bucket = \"me-south-1-testing\"\n    key    = \"test\"\n    region = \"me-south-1\"\n  }\n}\n\noutput \"test\" {\n  value = timestamp()\n}\n```\n\nOutputs:\n\n```\n$ terraform apply\n\nApply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.\n\nOutputs:\n\ntest = 2019-07-30T12:49:19Z\n```\n\nIf the new region is not properly enabled for the account, errors like the below will be received:\n\n```\n$ terraform init\n\nInitializing the backend...\n\nError: error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.\n```\n\nTo use this region before this update:\n\n```hcl\nterraform {\n  # ... potentially other configuration ...\n\n  backend \"s3\" {\n    # ... other configuration ...\n\n    region                 = \"me-south-1\"\n    skip_region_validation = true\n  }\n}\n```\n","author_name":"Brian
