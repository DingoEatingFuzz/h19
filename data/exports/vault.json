Given a collection of Vault nodes and an initialized storage backend, they will all go into standby waiting for initialization. After one node is initialized, the other nodes had no mechanism by which they \"re-check\" to see if unseal keys are present. This adds a goroutine to the server command which continually waits for unseal keys to exist. It exits in the following conditions:\r\n\r\n- the node is unsealed\r\n- the node does not support stored keys\r\n- a fatal error occurs (as defined by Vault)\r\n- the server is shutting down\r\n\r\nIn all other situations, the routine wakes up at the specified interval and attempts to unseal with the stored keys.\r\n","author_name":"Seth

Brian pointed out that startReplication and stopReplication expect to be called with that lock held.  Going back and looking at the changes as a whole, we see that reindex, which was previously the goroutine launched by handleReplicationReindex, is now being used in three additional places: prepareSecondary, FSM.Run (via config.ReindexFunc), and startReplicationEnt.  It makes sense to keep that for the sake of updating the last-reindex time: we're exposing that new replicationstatus field to the user, so it should reflect reality.  However we don't have tests that exercise the new start/stop replication behaviour in the context of prepareSecondary or FSM.Run, and their doing that isn't part of the new async-reindex-on-startup feature.  So they are now calling reindex with a new option to not do the start/stop replication.\n","author_name":"Nick Cabatoff","author_email":"ncabatoff@hashicorp.com","parents":["051e1cdc32a1ad651e02e3d8213a5ef68ef81cd5"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"enthelpers/merkle/merkle_composite_ent.go","changes":18,"insertions":3,"deletions":11,"binary":false},{"file":"enthelpers/merkle/merkle_composite_ent_test.go","changes":17,"insertions":10,"deletions":3,"binary":false},{"file":"integ/replication_test.go","changes":4,"insertions":1,"deletions":2,"binary":false},{"file":"vault/replication_api_ent.go","changes":34,"insertions":12,"deletions":14,"binary":false},{"file":"vault/replication_util_ent.go","changes":9,"insertions":3,"deletions":4,"binary":false}],"insertions":40,"deletions":42,"changed":5}},{"hash":"744412be3eb96433d5a73df54f2cae02498b3a81","date":"2019-02-05 16:43:05 -0500","message":"Use a write lock instead of a read lock.

Fix bug whereby access to a subtree named X would expose existence of a the key named X at the same level.\r\n\r\n* Add benchmarks, which showed that hasNonDenyCapability would be \"expensive\" to call for every member of a large folder.  Made a couple of minor tweaks so that now it can be done without allocations.\r\n\r\n* Comment cleanup.\r\n\r\n* Review requested changes: rename some funcs, use routeCommon instead of\r\nquerying storage directly.\r\n\r\n* Keep the same endpoint for now, but move it from a LIST to a POST and allow multiple paths to be queried in one operation.\r\n\r\n* Modify test to pass multiple paths in at once.\r\n\r\n* Add endpoint to default policy.\r\n\r\n* Move endpoint to /sys/access/filtered-path.\r\n","author_name":"ncabatoff","author_email":"nick.cabatoff@gmail.com","parents":["ba20ebdfdb50bbfe9532653b107d142c1a0e5854"],"diff":{"files":[{"file":"vault/acl.go","changes":7,"insertions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"vault/acl_test.go","changes":30,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vault/logical_system.go","changes":112,"insertions":3,"deletions":1,"binary":false},{"file":"vault/logical_system_paths.go","changes":16,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vault/logical_system_test.go","changes":147,"insertions":5,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vault/policy_store.go","changes":4,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vault/router.go","changes":5,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/github.com/google/go-cmp/LICENSE","changes":27,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/cmpopts/equate.go","changes":89,"insertions":3,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/cmpopts/ignore.go","changes":145,"insertions":5,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/cmpopts/sort.go","changes":147,"insertions":5,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../google/go-cmp/cmp/cmpopts/struct_filter.go","changes":182,"insertions":7,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/cmpopts/xform.go","changes":35,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/compare.go","changes":599,"insertions":21,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../go-cmp/cmp/internal/diff/debug_disable.go","changes":17,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../go-cmp/cmp/internal/diff/debug_enable.go","changes":122,"insertions":5,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../google/go-cmp/cmp/internal/diff/diff.go","changes":363,"insertions":13,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../google/go-cmp/cmp/internal/function/func.go","changes":49,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../google/go-cmp/cmp/internal/value/format.go","changes":280,"insertions":10,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../go-cmp/cmp/internal/value/pointer_purego.go","changes":23,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../go-cmp/cmp/internal/value/pointer_unsafe.go","changes":26,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../google/go-cmp/cmp/internal/value/sort.go","changes":104,"insertions":4,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/options.go","changes":456,"insertions":16,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/path.go","changes":309,"insertions":11,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/reporter.go","changes":53,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/unsafe_panic.go","changes":15,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":".../github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/unsafe_reflect.go","changes":23,"insertions":1,"deletions":0,"binary":false},{"file":"vendor/vendor.json","changes":30,"insertions":2,"deletions":0,"binary":false}],"insertions":3407,"deletions":8,"changed":28}},{"hash":"05240c26d54a6cafc71648e576e9e36f91a6e0e2","date":"2019-03-04 20:26:20 +0000","message":"Batch hmac -

roles\r\n\r\nAWS now allows you to pass policy ARNs as well as, and in addition to,\r\npolicy documents for AssumeRole and GetFederationToken (see\r\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/05/session-permissions/).\r\nVault already collects policy ARNs for iam_user credential types; now it\r\nwill allow policy ARNs for assumed_role and federation_token credential\r\ntypes and plumb them through to the appropriate AWS calls.\r\n\r\nThis brings along a minor breaking change. Vault roles of the\r\nfederation_token credential type are now required to have either a\r\npolicy_document or a policy_arns specified. This was implicit\r\npreviously; a missing policy_document would result in a validation error\r\nfrom the AWS SDK when retrieving credentials. However, it would still\r\nallow creating a role that didn't have a policy_document specified and\r\nthen later specifying it, after which retrieving the AWS credentials\r\nwould work. Similar workflows in which the Vault role didn't have a\r\npolicy_document specified for some period of time, such as deleting the\r\npolicy_document and then later adding it back, would also have worked\r\npreviously but will now be broken.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this breaking change is because a credential_type of\r\nfederation_token without either a policy_document or policy_arns\r\nspecified will return credentials that have equivalent permissions to\r\nthe credentials the Vault server itself is using. This is quite\r\ndangerous (e.g., it could allow Vault clients access to retrieve\r\ncredentials that could modify Vault's underlying storage) and so should\r\nbe discouraged. This scenario is still possible when passing in an\r\nappropriate policy_document or policy_arns parameter, but clients should\r\nbe explicitly aware of what they are doing and opt in to it by passing\r\nin the appropriate role parameters.\r\n\r\n* Error out on dangerous federation token retrieval\r\n\r\nThe AWS secrets role code now disallows creation of a dangerous role\r\nconfiguration; however, pre-existing roles could have existed that would\r\ntrigger this now-dangerous code path, so also adding a check for this\r\nconfiguration at credential retrieval time.\r\n\r\n* Run
